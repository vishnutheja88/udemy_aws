- Dedicated infrstructure layer for facilitating service-to-service communications, optimize, fast, reliable and secure.
- **Configuratble**, low-latency infrstructure layer designed to handle a **high volume of network-based interposes** communication along applicaiton infrstructure service.
- The servicemesh usually implemented by providing a proxy instance, called a **sidecar**, for a each service instance.
- **Sidecars** handle interservice communications, monitoring, and security-related concerns- indeed, anything that can be abstracted awsay from the individual service.
